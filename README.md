&nbsp;
-PHP (Using version 8.2.11)

Firstly, we need to connect our app to the Postgresql database. In order to achieve that, Create a new Database using PGAdmin, go to the .env file of the project and change the following to match the credentials 
of the database you created:
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

DB_HOST=Your_Host_Name
